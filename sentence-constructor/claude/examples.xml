    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show japanese characters, the cells are just blanks
    - BAD: the beginning sentence is unnecessary, should just show the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: the sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location][Subject][Verb], [Object][Verb-past]?

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table of vocabulary that might be helpful:
    |   Japanese    |   Romaji	|   English
    |               |   kuma    |   bear    |
    |               |   tobira	|   door    |
    |               |   gomi	|   garbage |
    |               |   naka	|   inside/out|
    |               |   soto	|   outside |
    |               |   aru	    |   to exist, to be |
    |               |   okosu	|   to put out, to leave out    |
    |               |   miru	|   to see, to look |
    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We might need to use a question word (e.g., ?) to ask about the garbage. We also need to describe the location of the bears and the garbage.
    Can you think of how to say "at the door" in Japanese?
