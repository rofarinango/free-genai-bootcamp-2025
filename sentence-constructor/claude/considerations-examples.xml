        Considerations and Next Steps:

        For the first part, we need to describe where the bears are
        - The second part is a question, so we'll need the question particle at the end
        - Remember that living things (like bears) use a different existence verb than non-living things
        - Consider the tense - the first part is present tense, while the second part is past tense
        - Think about which particles would show location and mark the subject
        </output>
        <score>6</score>
        <score:reason>
            This example score 6 because the returned information is too verbose
        </score:reason>

        Considerations and Next Steps:
        - Think about how to say "at the door" in Japanese. You'll need a location marker.
        - Bears are living things, so use the correct verb for their existence.
        - To ask "Did you leave the garbage out?" you'll need the past tense of "to put out."
        - Consider using "outside" to specify where the garbage was left.
